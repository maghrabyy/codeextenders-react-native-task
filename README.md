# CodeExtenders RN Task  

## Project Overview  

**CodeExtenders RN Task** is a React Native task submission for CodeExtenders. This application showcases essential functionalities such as fetching data, navigation, state management, and local data persistence. Users can browse products, view details, manage a favorites list, and persist favorite items using Async Storage.  
## Features  

- **Product Listing**: Displays a variety of products fetched from the Fake Store API.  
- **Product Details**: Navigate to a detailed view of any selected product.  
- **Favorites Management**:  
  - Add products to a favorites list.  
  - View the list of favorite products.  
  - Remove items from the favorites list.  
- **Data Persistence**: Favorite product IDs are stored in local async storage to retain data across app sessions.  
## Tech Stack  

- **React Native (EXPO)**: For building cross-platform mobile applications.  
- **Redux Toolkit**: For efficient state management.  
- **React Navigation**: For navigation between screens.  
- **React Native Paper**: For visually appealing UI components.  
- **Async Storage**: For local data persistence.
